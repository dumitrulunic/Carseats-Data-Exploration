# **E-Learning Analysis: Dumitrul Lunic & Andrei-Flavius Vacaru**

## **Project Overview**
This project explores the "Carseats" dataset from the **ISLR** package. The primary goal is to analyze the dataset using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques. It also includes statistical tests to validate assumptions about the data, such as normality checks.

## **Key Tasks**
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Loading the dataset.
   - Inspecting the data structure using summary statistics and visualization.
   
2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculation of key metrics like mean and standard deviation for variables of interest.
   - Construction of tables for categorical variables.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to visualize relationships and distributions.
   - Overlapping normal distribution curves for visual comparison.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Conducting normality tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test) to assess the distribution of the Sales variable.

## **Tech Stack**
- **R Packages**:
  - `ggplot2` for visualization.
  - `ISLR` for the dataset.
  - `car` and `lmtest` for statistical tests.
- **Tools**:
  - R Markdown for documentation and reporting.

## **Outputs**
- Visualizations to interpret variable distributions.
- Statistical insights to validate data characteristics.
